*A Wordle clone using five-letter words from the legendary Zelda game series*

## Purpose
I made this app early in my development days in order to learn React and Supabase. In development, it was also good practice for using a json web server temporarily for data.

It was also great practice deployment on Amazon Web Services, where I learned:

- [x] SSH connections to an Ubuntu T2 Micro on AWS
- [x] NGINX configuration with a built React app
- [x] Ensuring https by installing certificates
- [x] Automatic redirection to https from http
- [x] DNS to a purchased domain

I learned a lot making this app. I don't plan to develop it much further, other than to maybe change the keyboard order to querty.
